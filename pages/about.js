What you learn on the mat is useless if it cannot be put to practice off the mat. We would like to help you connect with yoga in a way that works for you and ensure that you are able to practice no matter where you are because ultimately  - Yoga is You.
              There are different ways to incorporate Yoga into life, including the basics of how we eat, sleep and everything in between!.
