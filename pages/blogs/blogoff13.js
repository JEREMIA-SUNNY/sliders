While that takes a bit to get working, I do a few self medicating tricks on myself. These would be very helpful to anyone who experiences this, especially those that are against pill popping!`}</p>

          <p className="mt-2 p-4  font-semibold  font-bah">{`1Ô∏è‚É£ A gentle massage of course helps, for those that don't know, a massage on the back of the neck also helps soothe a headache, especially when the pain is stress prone. `}</p>
          <p className="mt-2 p-4  font-semibold  font-bah">{`2Ô∏è‚É£Drinking a good amount of lukewarm water and maybe a light snack (avoid heavy calories food items) also helps, especially if the pain is due to hunger or dehydration.`}</p>
